# Benefits of a Multi-Tier Serverless App

- **Separation of concerns**: Each layer (frontend, API, database, storage) is managed independently
- **Security**: Business logic and sensitive data are protected in backend tiers
- **Scalability**: AWS Lambda and API Gateway scale on demand; S3 scales for static assets
- **Resilience**: No single point of failure; each component is managed by AWS
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay-per-use for all components; no servers running idle

This pattern is used by modern enterprises for high-traffic, global-scale apps.
